#### Discussing NUnit

Most likely, you want to do more than just talk about NUnit, but
discussing future directions and options is one of the key things
we do as a community.

Currently, such discussions take place on the [[nunit-discuss group|http://groups.google.com/group/nunit-discuss]] on Google groups. This is where both developers and users get together and it's usually the first place where new ideas are brought up, discussed and either accepted or passed over.

If you join us there and participate in the discussions, we'll get to know you and your contributions.

#### Joining GitHub

NUnit is maintained on [[GitHub|https://github.com]] so your next step will be to 
[[set up your GitHub account|https://github.com/signup/free]].

GitHub provides a handy list of the steps you should follow after setting up your account
at [[Bootcamp|https://help.github.com/categories/54/articles]]. We won't repeat the instructions here.

**Note:** *While we're in transition, it's still possible to work on some NUnit projects
on Launchpad. We don't recommend this for new contributors. All code will be on GitHub soon.*

#### Clone and Build NUnit

You should clone the NUnit project you want to work on and make sure you are able to build it
from source and run tests successfully. Ask us for help if you run into problems.

#### Joining the Developer List

Discussion of the actual development of NUnit takes place on the [[NUnit developer list|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nunit-developer]]. You should join the
list and introduce yourself. Tell us a bit about your background and what you would
like to work on.
