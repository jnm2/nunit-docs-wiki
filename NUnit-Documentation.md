This documentation covers NUnit 3.0 through 3.2.

Where applicable, we have marked sections with the version in which a feature 
first appeared.

If you are new to NUnit, we suggest you begin by reading the 
**Getting Started** section of this site.
Those who have used earlier releases may want to begin with the 
[[Upgrading]] section.

See the [[Release Notes]] for more information on each release.
